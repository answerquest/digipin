# DIGIPIN Python Implementation - Unofficial Version

DIGIPIN is a geocoding system developed by India Post in collaboration with IIT Hyderabad. It divides India's geographical territory into uniform 4-meter by 4-meter units, assigning each a unique 10-character alphanumeric code derived from latitude and longitude coordinates. This system enhances address precision, facilitating efficient delivery of public and private services across India.

## Features

- **Generate DIGIPIN**: Compute the DIGIPIN based on latitude and longitude inputs.
- **Decode DIGIPIN**: Retrieve the latitude and longitude for a given DIGIPIN.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures latitude and longitude are within acceptable ranges.
- **Precision Levels**: Supports up to 10 levels of precision for detailed location encoding.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or later.

## Installation from PyPI

You can install this package via pip:

```bash
pip install digipin
```

## Usage

### Encoding

Import the `DigiPin` class and use its `encode` method:

```python
from digipin import DigiPin

try:
    dpin = DigiPin.encode(15.5, 65.7)
    print(f"DIGIPIN: {dpin}")
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
```

#### Output

```bash
DIGIPIN: GL8-874-X3GW
```

### Decoding

Use the `decode` method of the `DigiPin` class:

```python
from digipin import DigiPin

try:
    latlon = DigiPin.decode('GL8-874-X3GW')
    print(f"(Lat, Long): {latlon}")
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
```

#### Output

```bash
(Lat, Long): (15.5, 65.70001)
```

## Input Constraints

- **Latitude Range**: 1.50 to 39.00
- **Longitude Range**: 63.50 to 99.00

If the inputs are out of range, the function raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate message.

## What is DIGIPIN?

The Department of Posts, also known as India Post, is undertaking a project to establish a standardized, nationwide geo-coded addressing system by developing a National-level Grid known as DIGIPIN. 

The implementation of this Digital Addressing system would ensure simplified addressing solutions for citizen-centric delivery of public and private services. A standardized geo-coded addressing system would enhance Indiaâ€™s geo-spatial structure. It would add to the geospatial knowledge stack of the country in line with the National Geospatial Policy 2022, which seeks to strengthen the geospatial sector to support national development, economic prosperity, and a thriving information economy.

## Understanding DIGIPIN

DIGIPIN is an alphanumeric offline grid system that divides India's geographical territory into uniform 4-meter by 4-meter units. Each unit is assigned a unique 10-character alphanumeric code derived from its latitude and longitude coordinates. This system provides precise location-based identification, especially useful in areas with unstructured or changing addresses.
